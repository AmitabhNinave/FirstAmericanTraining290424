1. Design a website for a College. There should be at least 15 web-pages present in the web-site. There 
should be: 
 One Home page that leads to other pages. The Home page should contain the name of the 
college as heading along with the college logo. There should be a tab with the following links: 
 Home; 
 Academics; 
 Admission; 
 Gallery. 
 There should be an appropriate description of the college on the home 
page. 
 One Academics page which contains a list of all the departments present in the college â€“ 
Arts, Science and Commerce. The list should be a nested list, with available courses mentioned 
under each department. There should be a minimum of two courses under each department, 
(for e.g. Computer Science and Mathematics under Science, English and Sociology under Arts 
and so on). Each Course entry in the list should be a HTML link that leads to a web-page 
totally dedicated to the course itself. 
 Each Course should have its own dedicated web-page. This page should contain a description 
about the course, a list of all the teachers taking the course and the timetable for that particular 
subject. 
 The Admission page basically contains a form that a student needs to fill up in order to take 
admission in the college. The form should ask all the necessary questions using appropriate 
form elements. 
 One gallery page that contains set of photos taken of the college and its students. 
Please note that each web-page in this website should have the same background Image/color. 
The looks of each page should be similar.
